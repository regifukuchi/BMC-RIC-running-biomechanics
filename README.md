# BMC-RIC-running-biomechanics
 This repository is a supplementary material of a manuscript that is currently under review. A link to the manuscript will be provided once it is published. 
 
 The repository contains the dataset and the code used in the manuscript. The dataset is a collection of running biomechanics data from 23 recreational runners from the Biomechanics and Motor Control Laboratory ([BMC](https://bmclab.pesquisa.ufabc.edu.br/)) of the Federal University of ABC, Brazil; and 23 runners from the Running Injury Clinic (RIC) of the University of Calgary, Canada. 
 
 The code is provided in Jupyter notebooks and can be run in Google Colab.
